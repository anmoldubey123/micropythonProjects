## About MicroPython

**MicroPython** is a lightweight software implementation of the Python 3 programming language, written in C, and optimized for microcontrollers. It brings the power and simplicity of Python to resource-constrained environments, making it ideal for embedded systems and hardware programming.

### Key Features:
- **Python Compiler & Runtime Interpreter**: MicroPython compiles Python code into bytecode and executes it using a runtime interpreter. 
- **Interactive REPL**: An interactive prompt (REPL) allows users to execute commands instantly, facilitating quick testing and debugging.
- **Core Libraries**: Includes a subset of Python's standard libraries, along with hardware-specific modules to interact directly with microcontroller peripherals.

Explore this repository to learn, innovate, and build exciting hardware-based projects with the simplicity and elegance of Python!
